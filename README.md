# Bargent
## created by Ivan Chau, Brendon Ho and Aneesh Atri.

A pretty okay MHacks project using Capital One's Nessie API and IBM's Alchemy API. 

Bargent is an app to quantify and track your expenses. This is done through a sorting algorithm, knowledge of your past expenses, and statistics across the nation. It is built with a NodeJS and Express backend, Swift, and Jade.

## mission

Bargent's main mission is to help people learn from their expenses. Using each expense's description (Nessie API), your purchases and transactions are sorted by category (Alchemy API). This way, you can see which category is hitting your wallet the hardest. You can also look at your individual category, allowing you to see how your current month's expenses compares with previous months, (whether you spent more this month than the last), how your expenses compare with the national average, and the percentage of how much your category composes your total expenses. 

This is all to help the user understand where they stand amongst not only the rest of America in terms of where they put their money, but also their past selves- how their spending has changed from previous months. Users will now know where their money is going and allow them to change their spending to minimize the impact on their wallet.

## testing

To run, "cd" into the repository and run 'node app'. Open the ios Nessie workspace and run with target 'Bargent'.

Hope you enjoy!
